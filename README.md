#   SE 309 Project.

## Getting started

MK1_8 is the name of my team, this project is the work from a whole semester, as our team developes this game. I hope you take a look, and perhaps maybe you will enjoy the game as well.

For this game to start you need to be able to run the frontend and backend actively. But it is best to keep running through a CI/CD pipeline. It is not currently set up on GitHub as it this was moved over from GitLab. There is a demonstration video here if you want to see it in action
